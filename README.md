# GoldenGlovesFinalProject

## Topic:
When deciding on the focus on the project, we had two main objectives: first, we wanted to work with a topic that held our interests, and second, to find a topic with a reliable, accessibly large data source.  With the first objective in mind, we decided our project should be sports releated.  While there are many available sports databases, we concluded that baseball would best meet our needs.  All that was left was to figure out how to utilize our found data to our advantage. We decided to use the historical data to look at the stats of Baseball Hall of Fame nominees and inductees. 

## Data Sources:
Lahman Statistical Archive
https://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/

## Hypothesis:
After reviewing the data, we developed our hypothesis that the Lahman statistical archive contains enough data to be able to predict which players will be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. We will test our hypothesis by using aggregated stats for each player in regard to batting, fielding, and pitching. Using this data we can attempt to predict hall of fame status using a classificication machine learning method.

## Approach:
With our data found and hypothesis formed, we dived into the project by first creating out databases.  We used Python to create databases by merging data sources, trimming unnecessary and noisy data, and forming smaller, focused databases to in order to maximize our machine learning results
