## Topic:
Using historical data to look at the status of Baseball Hall of Famers and how they were inducted into the Hall of Fame. 

## Data Sources:
https://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/

## Hypothesis:
Our hypothesis is that the lahman statistical archive contains enough data that predicts players that get inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Aggregate stats for each player in regard to batting, fielding, and pitching. Using this data we can attempt to predict hall of fame status using a classificication machine learning method.

## Approach:
##SQL - Uploading coresponding data sources into SQL and then join all relevetn data into one data frame.
##Machine Learning - Use Python for Machine Learning to determine from current Hall of Famers if there are any trends in the Lahmen statistics and use either deep learning or random forrest classification to help answer the hypothesis and apply that to future Hall of Fame candidates. 
##JavaScript - Use Java Script to create a dashboard to display our findings.
