          <h2>Why Baseball?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="w-col w-col-8">
          <p>There have been a total of 19,969 Major League Baseball players since 1876, but only 268 former players got to enter the Hall of Fame making only 1.34% of all players! With this we knew there would be loads of data that would be available, in fact there were hundreds of data sets each containing hundreds of thousands of lines of data which is exactly what we were looking for. We immediately knew the MLB would be the source of our data and we wanted to figure out how we can create a hypothesis and test it with Machine Learning. We figured out that we wanted to test if we can create a Machine Learning algorithm to figure out why the amount of players in the Hall of Fame is so small, what made these players different than the rest, and how can we use any correlation to try and predict whether future players will be inducted. </p>

          <p>- Tableau: Use Tableau to create an interactive dashboard for graphs to show statistics and an easier way to view our findings<br><br>- Machine Learning: Use Python for Machine Learning to determine from current Hall of Famers if there are any trends in the Lahman statistics and use either deep learning or random forest classification to help answer the hypothesis and apply that to future Hall of Fame candidates.<br><br>- JavaScript and HTML: Use JavaScript and HTML to construct a dashboard to act as an interactive host for our data and to describe our project</p>

      <div class="process-row w-row">
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <h3 class="work-type">Research everything</h3>
          <p>We first needed to figure out what our topic would be. Searching through almost all topics to see what data was available and what we would be able to test. We ended up using Lahman Statistical Archive which contained all the data we needed and more.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <h3 class="work-type">Plan Everything</h3>
          <p>Our next step was working to look through all the data available and sort what we needed and what was useful. We knew we were going to test if we could predict MLB Hall of Fame inductees. We planned who would do what based on skillset. We then had to plan how we used the data to create our hypothesis.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="process-row w-row">
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <h3 class="work-type">Create a Hypothesis</h3>
          <p>After our planning and based of what we wanted to prove we came to our hypothesis. We hypothesize that the Lahman Statistical Archive contained enough data to predict whether players get inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Aggregate stats for each player in regard to batting, fielding, and pitching. Using this data we can attempt to predict hall of fame status using a classificication machine learning method.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <h3 class="work-type">Outline the Code</h3>
          <p>With our hypothesis set, we needed to know how we were going to make things work how we wanted. During this stage we decided to use classification Machine Learning, and laid out how our code was going to look. For visualization we used Tableau which we embedded, and for our dashboard we used HTML, JavaScript and CSS.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="process-row w-row">
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <h3 class="work-type">Show off our skills</h3>
          <p>Finally it was time to put our skills to use. With our code outlined, and our roles planned, we were finally ready to take our planning and get to work. We began to code, collaborate, and finalize what we wanted to do.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <h3 class="work-type">Give everyone a Hi Five </h3>
          <p>With everything perfect and how we wanted it, we were able to prove our hypothesis, show off our skills, and celebrate our efforts.</p>
